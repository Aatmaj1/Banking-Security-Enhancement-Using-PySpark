# Banking-Security-Enhancement-Using-PySpark
A robust fraud detection system was constructed, leveraging the massive data processing capabilities of Apache PySpark. The technology effectively incorporates the Banking dataset provided by Capital One to meticulously analyze a vast volume of bank transactions on a daily basis, with the aim of detecting possible instances of fraudulent behavior.

The project involved conducting a thorough exploratory data analysis and visualization using PySpark SQL functions. This allowed for the discovery of key signs of fraudulent activity. The central component of the system is located inside its predictive models, which have been meticulously calibrated through the utilization of PySpark MLlib. These models leverage sophisticated classifiers to attain exceptional levels of prediction precision. 

By working together as a unified group, we showcased our expertise in PySpark, Python, and SQL, while developing a scalable solution that was thoroughly documented using Jupyter Notebooks. This endeavor serves as evidence of utilizing technology to improve banking security, hence contributing to a more secure financial landscape.
